## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

In the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, we were requested to build the R script `run_analyis.R`, which does the following:

1. Downloads the data if it does not exist in the working diretory.

2. Loads the features and the activity info, keeping descriptive activity names, instead of numeric values.

3. Loads both training and test dataset and, together, loads the activity and subject data for each dataset.

4. Merges respective activity and subject data with the two datasets.

5. Merges the two sets.

6. Keeps only the measurements that reflects mean and standard deviation. 

7. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

8. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject pair.

The final result is shown in the file `tidy.txt`.
